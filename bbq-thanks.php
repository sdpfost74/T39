<h1>BBQ Pre-order Confirmation</h1>

<div style="text-align:left;padding-left:15px;">
<h2 style="margin-left:0;">Thank you for your order...Now What?</h2> 

<p>In the next few minutes, you will receive a confirmation email with your order details. We suggest printing that out and putting somewhere you can get to it easily <em>(sticking on the fridge is good...but it might make you impatient for that awesome food!)</em></p>

<p>Secondly, you will be contacted by a troop member within the next few days to:</p>
 
<ol> 
  <li>Verify your order (yep, go get it off the fridge)</li>
  <li>Confirm final price</li>
  <li>Arrange for payment</li>
  <li>and best of all...how to get you your order</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are not contacted within 7 days of your order, please send us an email <a href="mailto:bbq@matthewstroop39.com?subject=BBQ order, but no confirmation">HERE</a>

<p>Again, from all of the troop, thank you for your support!</p>
